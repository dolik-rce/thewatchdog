        <h1>Welcome to The Watchdog</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>The Watchdog is a simple continuous integration server. It is a bit similar to Jenkins, but simpler, faster and far less resource hungry.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>The server monitors changes in version control system (currently only svn is supported, support for git will come later). Multiple clients can be configured to run in distributed fashion, each one following particular path in the repository and runnning tests when appropriate. The results are sent back to the server, stored and displayed using the web interface. Developpers can optionally receive updates and informations via emails or RSS feed.</p>

<p>TODO ...</p>

<h2>What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>The server has been succesfully run on machines with as low as 128MB RAM and 800 MHz cpu. It would probably run on even weaker hardware, but I didn't found any :-) Apart from the hardware to run the server, only mysql (or mariadb) server is needed and machines for running the clients. Of course, nothing prevents having all three (server, clients and mysql) on single hardware if it is powerfull enough.</p>

<h2>How to build it?</h2>
